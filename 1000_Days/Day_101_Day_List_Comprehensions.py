# Concept:
# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They are more compact and readable than traditional loops and offer a way to generate lists by performing operations on each item in an existing iterable or by filtering items.

# using for loops
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i ** 2)
